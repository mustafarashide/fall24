	\begin{questions}
		\setcounter{question}{4} \question  There are distinct integers $m$ and $n$ such that $\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}$ is an integer.
		
		\begin{solution}
			 Suppose $m=-2$ and $n=2$, then:
			 $$\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n} = -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}=0$$
			 The statement is true since $0 \in \mathbb{Z}$
		\end{solution}
		
		\setcounter{question}{12} \question For all integers m and n, if $2m+n$ is odd then $m$ and $n$ are both odd.
		
	 \begin{solution}
	 	The counterexample would have to satisfy the statement $\exists m,n \in Z$ such that $2m+n$ is odd and $n$ is even or $m$ is even\\
	 	Suppose $m=4$ and $n=1$, then
	 	$$2m+n = 2\cdot4 + 1 = 9$$
	 	9 is odd by definition because $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $9=2n+1$ and $n=4$ is even by definition because $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $4=2k$ so $m=4$ and $n=1$ is a counterexample that disproves the statement.
	 \end{solution}
		
		\setcounter{question}{40} \question \textbf{Theorem:} The product of an even integer and an odd integer is even.\\
		"\textbf{Proof:} Suppose $m$ is an even integer and $n$ is an odd integer. If $m\cdot n$ is even, then by definition of even there exists an integer $r$ such that $m\cdot n = 2r$. Also since $m$ is even, there exists an integer $p$ such that $m=2p$, and since $n$ is odd there exists an integer $q$ such that $n=2q+1$. Thus $$mn = (2p)(2q+1) = 2r,$$ where $r$ is an integer. By definition of even, then, $m\cdot n$ is an even, as was to be shown."
		\begin{solution}
			The proof confuses what is known and what is still to be shown. It is known that the definition of even for an integer $n$ is $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n=2k$ but the proof assumes that is the case for $m\cdot n$ without showing or proving it.
		\end{solution}
		
		\setcounter{question}{56} \question If $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $mn$ is a perfect square, then $m$ and $n$ are perfect squares.   
		
		\begin{solution}
			$\forall m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $m\cdot n$ is a perfect square, then $m$ and $n$ are perfect squares.\\
			The statement is false, we can prove this by finding a counterexample that satisfies:
			$\exists m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $m\cdot n$  is a perfect square and $m$ is not a perfect square or $n$ is not a perfect square
			\begin{proof}
			Suppose $m=2$ and $n=18$ then by definition of perfect square $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $mn = k^2$
			$$mn = 2\cdot18$$
			$$36 = 6^2$$
			However that is not the case for $m$ or $n$ as we can see that $\exists l \notin \mathbb{Z}$ such that $m=l^2$ or $\exists q \notin \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n=q^2$
			$$l = \sqrt[]{2}$$
			$$q = \sqrt[]{18}$$
			\end{proof}
		\end{solution}
		
		\setcounter{question}{57} \question The difference of the squares of any two consecutive integers is odd. 
		
		\begin{solution}
			$\forall m,n \in \mathbb{Z}$ if $m$ and $n$ are consecutive then $m^2-n^2$ is odd
			\begin{proof}
				Suppose $m$ and $n$ are consecutive integers\\
				Because $m$ and $n$ are consecutive, then by definition either 1 or 2\\
				$$m=n+1$$ 
				$$n=m+1$$
			\end{proof}
