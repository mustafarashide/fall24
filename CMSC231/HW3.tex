	\begin{questions}
	
	\question  A menagerie consists of seven brown dogs, two black dogs, six gray cats, ten black cats, five blue birds, six yellow birds, and one black bird. Determine which of the following statements are true and which are false.
	\begin{parts}
		\part Every animal in the menagerie is brown or gray or black.
		\part There is an animal in the menagerie that is neither a cat nor a dog.
		\part No animal in the menagerie is blue.
		\part There are in the menagerie a dog, a cat, and a bird that all have the same color.
	\end{parts}
	\begin{solution}
		\begin{parts}
			\part False. There is a blue bird.
			\part True.
			\part False. There is a blue bird.
			\part True.
		\end{parts}
	\end{solution}
	\question Find a counterexample to show that the statement below is false.\\
		\begin{center}
			$\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, (a-1)/a \textrm{ is not an integer.}$
		\end{center} 

	\begin{solution}
		The negation of the statement would be $\exists a \in \mathbb{Z}, (a-1)/a \textrm{ is an integer.}$
		If $a=0$, $a-1/1$ = $0$ which is $\in \mathbb{Z}$. Since the negation is true for $a=0$ the original statement is false.
	\end{solution}
	
	\question Rewrite each of the following statements in the form "$\forall$  \makebox[1cm]{\hrulefill} $x,$  \makebox[1cm]{\hrulefill}.
	\begin{parts}
		\part Every real number is positive, negative, or zero.
		\part No logicians are lazy.
		\part The number $-1$ is not equal to the square of any real number.
	\end{parts}
	
	\begin{solution}
		A3. (double check a)
		\begin{parts}
			\part $\forall$ real numbers $x, x>0 \lor x<0 \lor x=0$ 
			\part $\forall$ logicians $l$, $l$ is not lazy
			\part $\forall$ real numbers $x, x^2 \neq -1$
		\end{parts}
	\end{solution}
	
	\question In any mathematics or computer science text other than this book, find an example of a statement that is universal but is implicitly quantified. Copy the statement as it appears and rewrite it making the quantification explicit. Give a complete citation for your example, including title, author, publisher, year, and page number.
	
	\begin{solution}
		Theorem 9.1: Convergence of a Monotone, Bounded Sequence\\
		If a sequence $s_n$ is bounded and monotone, it converges.
		
		For every sequence $s_n$, if $s_n$ is bounded and monotone, $s_n$ converges.
		
		Citation: Calculus 6th edition by Hughes-Hallet, Gleaason, McCallum et al., Wiley \& Sons, Inc., 2013, page 495

			\part $ab=0 \implies a=0$ or $b=0$
			\part $a<b$ and $c<d \implies ac<bd$
		\end{parts}
	\begin{solution}
		\begin{parts}
			\part True.

			Example (1)\\
			$a=-2, b=-1, c=-5, d=-3$\\
			$a<b$ and $c<d$\\
			$ac \geq bd$
			\newpage
			Example (2)\\
			$a=1, b=2, c=-5, d=-4$\\
			$a<b$ and $c<d$\\
			$ac \geq bd$\\

		\part There is a disloyal animal that is not a dog.
		\part There is a dog that is disloyal.
		\part No animals that are not dogs are loyal.
		\part Some animals that are not dogs are loyal.

	\question Determine whether the proposed negations is correct. If it is not, write a correct negation.\\
	\begin{parts}
		\part 	Statement: The product of any irrational number and any rational number is irrational.\\
		Proposed negation: The product of any irrational number and any rational number is rational.\\
		\part Statement: For all real numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$, if $x_1^2=x_2^2$ then $x_1=x_2$.\\
		Proposed negation: For all real numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$, if  $x_1^2=x_2^2$ then $x_1\neq x_2$.
	\end{parts}
	
	\begin{solution}
		\begin{parts}
			\part Incorrect.\\
			There is a rational number that is the product of an irrational number and a rational number.
			\part Incorrect.\\
			There exists real numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $x_1^2 = x_2^2$ and $x_1 \neq x_2$
		\end{parts}
	\end{solution}
	
	\question Write a negation for each statement.
	\begin{parts}
		\part $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $n$ is prime then $n$ is odd or $n=2$
		\part $\forall$ integers $n$, if $n$ is divisible by 6, then $n$ is divisible 2 and $n$ is divisible by 3
	\end{parts}
	\begin{solution}
		\begin{parts}
		\part $\exists n \in \mathbb{Z}$, such that $n$ is prime and $n$ is even and $n \neq 2$
		\part $\exists$ an integer $n$, such that $n$ is divisible by 6 and $n$ is not divisible by 2 or $n$ is not divisible by 3

	\question Give an example to show that a universal conditional statement is not logically equivalent to its inverse.
	
	\begin{solution}
		\begin{center}
		$\forall x \in D,$ if $P(x)$ then $Q(x) \not\equiv \forall x \in D$, if $\neg P(x)$ then $\neg Q(x)$
		\end{center}
		For all animals $x$, if $x$ is a dog then it can be a pet\\
		The inverse of the above statement would be:\\
		For all animals $x$, if $x$ is not a dog then it cannot be a pet\\
		This is false as there are pets that are not dogs!
	\end{solution}
	
	\question There is a triangle $x$ such that for all circles $y, y$ is above $x$. (Tarski World in Figure 3.3.1)
	\begin{solution}
		$\exists x$, $x$ is a triangle such that $\forall y$, $y$ is a circle, $y$ is above $x$
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
				choose $x$ & , then given $y=$ & check that $y$ is above $x$ \\ 
				f or i & a & yes \\  
				 & b & yes \\    
				 & c & yes
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
		For triangles f or i, no matter what circle y we choose, we find that the circle is above the triangle.
