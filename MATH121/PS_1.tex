		\question What is wrong with each of the following statements? Explain briefly.
		\begin{parts}
			\part "In 3-space $y=1$ is a line parallel to the x-axis."
			\part "The graph of the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ is a c
		\end{parts}
		\begin{solution}
			A1.
			
			\begin{parts}
				\part In 2-space $y=1$ is a line parallel to the $x$-axis, however in 3-space $y=1$ is not a line but a plane that is parallel to the $x$-axis.
				\part For the function $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ to be a circle it has to be a single variable function with value of $x$ or $y$ or $z$ set to a constant c. This will then be a graph in 2-space of a circle centered at $(0,0)$ with radius $\sqrt c$. However, the multi-variable function $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ is not a circle but it is bowl shaped with contour diagrams showing circles, with radii that vary as $f(x,y)$ is set to different constants $c$ where $c\geq 0$, concentric at $(0,0)$

		\question The following problems concern the concentration, $C$, in mg/liter, of a drug in the blood as a function of $x$, the amount, in mg, of the drug given and $t$, the time in hours since the injection. For $1\leq x \leq 4$ and $t \geq 0$ we have $C = f(x,t) = te^{-t(5-x)}$.
		\begin{parts}
			\part Find $f(3,2)$. Give units and interpret in terms of drug concentration.
			\part Graph the single variable function $f(4,t)$ (in the variable $t$) and explain its significance in terms of drug concentration.
			\part Graph $f(a,t)$ for $a=1,2,3,4$ on the same axes. Describe how the graph changes as $a$ increases and explain what this means in terms of drug concentration. 
		\end{parts}
		\begin{solution}
			A3.
			\begin{parts}
				\part $C = f(x,t) = te^{-t(5-x)}$\\
				$f(3,2) = ?$\\
				$x=3$ meaning that 3 mg of the drug was given\\
				$t=2$ meaning that 2 hours have passed since the injection\\
				$C$ or concentration of drug in mg/liter of 3 mg after 2 hours will be:\\
				$C = 2e^{-2(5-3)} = 0.04$ mg/liter
				
				The concentration in blood of 3 mg of the drug after 2 hours is 0.04 mg/liter 
				
				\part Drug concentration (mg/l) as a function of $x$, the amount in mg of the drug given, and $t$, the time in hours since the injection with $x$ held constant at 4 mg\\
				\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{question3b}
				
				\part As more mg of the drug is given, the maximum concentration of the dose in the blood in mg/l increases. This can be seen on the graphs as the peaks of the functions $f(4,t)$, $f(3,t)$, $f(2,t)$, and $f(1,t)$. The highest peak is at $a=4$ and the lowest peak is at $a=1$. The time $t$ hours since the injection for the drug to reach its maximum concentration increases as the value of $a$ or the the value of the dose given increases.

		\question Without a calculation or computer, match the functions (a)-(f) with their cross-sections with $x$ fixed in the Figure 1. Explain your reasoning
